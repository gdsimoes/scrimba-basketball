## My process

### Built with

-   Figma
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

The focus of this project was to practice using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. I have some experience with JavaScript, but primarily using Node, so this was a valuable exercise for me. On the design side of things, I learned how to use my own fonts without using a service like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and reviewed how to style buttons using pseudo-classes.

As "stretch goals," I highlighted the leader's score and created the reset function, which is fired whenever the user presses the 'r' key. To do this, I had to refresh my memory on how to toggle classes and how keyboard events work in JavaScript.

### Continued development

I look forward to creating more complex websites using advanced programming techniques.

### Useful resources

-   [MDN - aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) - The `aspect-ratio` property is not quite ready for production, but I wanted to gain some experience with it. As usual, MDN clearly and succinctly explains how this property works.
-   [MDN - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - Since I used my own fonts for the first time, I had to learn how to set up the CSS for this, i.e., how to use `@font-face`.
-   [freeCodeCamp - CSS Button Style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This article explains best practices for styling buttons using CSS.
